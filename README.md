# GlobalEfficiency_DiffusionEfficiency
Coding up global efficiency and diffusion efficiency and discuss the change across different graphs 

Global efficiency and diffusion efficiency is coded using the adjanceny matrix as input. By thresholding each adjacency matrix at different threshold values [0 :0:1 : 0:9], it is examined how global effciency and diffusion efficiency changes.
Graph morphospace is plotted in order to discuss more on thresholded graphs.
